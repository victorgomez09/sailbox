## Why we built this

We've been running self-hosted services for years. We used Coolify, Dokploy, CapRover — they're great projects and the teams behind them have done incredible work making self-hosting accessible. We're grateful they exist.

But as our workloads grew, we kept hitting the same ceiling. Under the hood, they rely on Docker Compose or Docker Swarm. That works well for many use cases — but when we needed real health checks, graceful rolling updates, autoscaling, or the ability to grow from one node to three, we found ourselves fighting the abstraction instead of shipping.

We kept thinking: Kubernetes already solves all of this. It has Deployments with health probes. It has HPA for autoscaling. It has CronJobs, StatefulSets, Ingress. But traditional Kubernetes is heavy — it demands multiple nodes, complex setup, and a dedicated ops team. That's overkill for most of us.

Then we found **[K3s](https://k3s.io)** — a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution packed into a single binary under 100 MB. It runs on a $5 VPS, a Raspberry Pi, or a bare-metal server with just 2 GB of RAM. Same Kubernetes API, same ecosystem, a fraction of the footprint.

So we built Sailbox on top of it.

You get all the power of Kubernetes — rolling updates, autoscaling, health probes, CronJobs — without any of the setup complexity. One `curl` command and you're running. Start with a single node, add workers when you're ready. And because everything is a real Kubernetes object, `kubectl` still works — your workloads are portable from day one.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.sailbox.dev | sudo sh
```

Opens at `http://your-server-ip:3000`. That's it.

**Upgrade:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.sailbox.dev/upgrade | sudo sh
```

> **Requirements:** Linux (x86_64 / arm64), 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM minimum. Runs on any VPS, bare metal, or Raspberry Pi.

## Features

#### Applications

- Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Team invitations via email

#### Notifications
- Email (SMTP) · Slack · Discord · Telegram
- Auto-fire on alert with per-channel toggle
